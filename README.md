# Kubernetes Tutor Alexa Skill
• Developed an Alexa Skill to assist users in learning Kubernetes concepts, commands, and best practices.  
• Utilized AWS Lambda, a pay-as-you-go service, to remotely host serverless code, reducing costs by 50% compared to EC2.  
• Integrated with OpenAI's GPT to answer specific Kubernetes-related queries dynamically.  
• Remotely hosted serverless code allowed access to this Alexa skill 24/7 from any Alexa device anywhere.  

This Alexa skill is designed to help users learn about Kubernetes by providing detailed information on various topics and commands. Users can ask the skill about specific Kubernetes topics, how to use different commands, or get dynamic answers to their questions through integration with OpenAI's GPT. This Alexa skill aims to simplify the learning process by providing easy access to information and guidance on Kubernetes usage.

## How to use this Alexa skill:  
To use this Alexa skill, simply enable it on your Alexa device and ask questions like:
    "Alexa, ask Kubernetes Helper to tell me about pods."
    "Alexa, ask Kubernetes Helper how to use the kubectl apply command."
    "Alexa, ask GPT how to create a new deployment in Kubernetes."

## Features:  
Topic Information: Users can ask for explanations on various Kubernetes topics such as pods and services.
Command Usage: Provides detailed usage information on common Kubernetes commands like kubectl apply, kubectl get, and more.
Dynamic Q&A: Integration with OpenAI's GPT allows users to ask specific questions and receive detailed, dynamic answers.

Developing this Alexa skill involved learning how to host serverless code using AWS Lambda, which provided a cost-effective and scalable solution. The integration with OpenAI's GPT was particularly exciting as it allowed for dynamic responses, making the skill more interactive and useful. I use this Alexa skill on a regular basis while learning more
about kubernetes and working on my personal projects.

One challenge encountered was handling the integration with the OpenAI API efficiently within the constraints of AWS Lambda. Optimizing the function to manage API calls and responses while ensuring a smooth user experience was a key focus.

### Future Improvements  
    Expand the database of Kubernetes topics and commands for more comprehensive coverage.
    Improve error handling and debugging processes for a smoother user experience.
    Explore additional integrations with other Kubernetes-related APIs and tools.
